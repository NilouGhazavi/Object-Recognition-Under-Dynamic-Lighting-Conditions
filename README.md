# Object Recognition Under Dynamic Lighting Conditions
 Object detection is a complex and diverse field within computer vision with broad applicability. The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has become popular in the development of models that can accurately identify and classify diverse image features. However, the performance of these models can be significantly impacted by dynamic lighting conditions. In real-world scenarios, lighting can vary greatly due to shadows and sunlight leading to changes in light intensity of 10-100-fold. Current CNN models do not account for this effect, resulting in poor performance in inconsistent lighting environments. The primary aim of this study is to optimize the ability of these models to detect and recognize objects accurately under a broad range of lighting conditions.
